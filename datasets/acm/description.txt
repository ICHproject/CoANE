This is a paper network from the ACM dataset.
There is an edge between two papers if they are written
by same author. Paper features are the bag-of-words of the
keywords. We select papers published in KDD, SIGMOD,
SIGCOMM, MobiCOMM and divide the papers into three
classes (database, wireless communication, data mining) by
their research area
